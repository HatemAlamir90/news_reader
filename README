News Reader!

If you, like me, want to know what is happening outside your small place where you spend most of the time behind your laptop screen, you most propable bookmark one of those websites with three or four letter icons, or have their mobile app thumbanil next to Facebook or, may be, LinkedIn.
Also, you may know that some people make big money out of reading and analyzing the news! Shouldn't be a surprise, right?

If the news themselves are increazingly digitized, it makes more sense to read and analyze them using computers! Big computers! At scale!

That's exactly what we're trying to "simulate" in this project!


[1] Recipe:
	- Cloudera Quick Start 5.13. Separate componensts listed below.
	- Apache Hadoop 1.6
	- Apache Spark 2.10 (Core, Streaming, and SQL)
	- Apache Kafka 
	- Scala 2.10.5
	- Python 3.7.7
	- The bunch of files in this repo. Obviously!

[2] Utensil kit:
	- IntelliJ IDEA - Community Edition

[3] Steps:
	$ python read_newsapi.py &
	This command will hit newsapi.org every hour to get top-news and write them to a kafka topic named 'news'.
	This files connects to a Kafka broker at quickstart.cloudera:9092. You might need to change that in the above file to refer to your <kafka host>:<kafka port>

	$ spark-submit --class KafkaNewsConsumer --master local finalproject/target/uber-finalproject-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar quickstart.cloudera:9092 my-group-id news

	$ ipython read_articles_kafka.py
	This will run the script that reads the saved articles from Hive, and draw a couple of graphs.
	The graphs will be drawn inline.
